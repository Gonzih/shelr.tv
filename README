ttyrec format Edit

A ttyrec consists of many frames. Each frame is made up of a
twelve-byte header and an arbitrarily long data block.

The twelve-byte header contains two pieces of information:
how much data is in this frame and a timestamp. The timestamp
is very precise; it has microsecond precision. The header
bytes are aligned like so:

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C
\-----/ \-----/ \-----/
  sec     usec    len

The bytes are in little-endian order (meaning least significant
bytes first). You can portably read and process frames like this, in C:

while (fread(header, 1, 12, stdin) == 12)
{
  sec  = (((((header[ 3] << 8) | header[ 2]) << 8) | header[1]) << 8) | header[0];
  usec = (((((header[ 7] << 8) | header[ 6]) << 8) | header[5]) << 8) | header[4];
  len  = (((((header[11] << 8) | header[10]) << 8) | header[9]) << 8) | header[8];

  received = fread(data, 1, len, stdin)
  if (len != received)
    break;

  /* process data */
}

/* either the ttyrec is done or we had an error */
